# 4. Median of Two Sorted Arrays

[Here](https://leetcode.com/problems/median-of-two-sorted-arrays/) is the link to the problem.


## What I learned
Reading and working with this taught me about iterators, `from_fn`, and similar
things.

`from_fn` is an insane tool to create an iterator over data very simply that
just works.
