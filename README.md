# Leetcode Problems

This is where I am storing all my leetcode problems that I have solved.

With this is the tests that I have written for each solution as well as a 
more "rusty" solution that makes the functions that are written more rust-like.
Though I am trying to make as many of them "rusty" to begin with anyways.

## Features
To run and use the "rusty" solutions compile and run with
`cargo run --bin <solution> --features rusty`

## Future Plans
I plan on making either a CLI or a TUI tool to go through all the solutions when I have enough to look at.
This will include ability to test and run the code as well as inspect other information on them.
